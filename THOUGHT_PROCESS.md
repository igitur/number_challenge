# Thought Process
Right off the bat it was clear that this project is in essence a recursive problem. However, there are a few special cases that can be considered upfront to shortcut/circuit-break the recursive process. For example, if the number is zero, we can immediately return "zero" or if the number is in the range 1-19, we can directly map it to its word representation.

The recursive algorithm is designed to handle numbers in segments, breaking them down into manageable parts. The recursion processes the number in chunks of three digits (hundreds, thousands, millions, etc.). This segmentation allows the function to handle large numbers efficiently.

Fine tuning (e.g. the inclusion of commas and the word "and") was left until last, after the core logic was working. This was to ensure that the primary functionality was solid before adding additional features.

Deliberate support for very large numbers was implemented. I hit an interesting floating point precision problem in the `math.log10` function and had to implement a crude, but sufficient alternative, demonstrating an understanding of numerical principles and problem solving.

A deliberate choice was to validate inputs and return appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.

A test-driven development (TDD) approach was employed to ensure the correctness of the implementation. The tests cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases like negative numbers and very large numbers, ensuring that the function behaves as expected in all situations. Tests were written before the implementation, guiding the development process and providing a safety net for future changes.

# DevOps
## Version Control
The project is managed using Git for version control. Each commit is meant to represent an atomic unit of work. The clear commit history is intended to make the thought process and the evolution of the understanding of the project clear and traceable.

## Environment Setup
The project uses `uv` for environment management and dependency installation. This choice was made to simplify the setup process and ensure consistency across different development environments.

## Testing
The test suite is built using `pytest`, which provides a robust framework for writing and running tests. The tests cover a range of scenarios, including edge cases, to ensure the reliability of the conversion logic.

## Continuous Integration
This project implements CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment processes. This ensures that code changes are automatically tested and validated before being merged into the main branch.
